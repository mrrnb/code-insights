# Code Insights

## What It Is

Turn your AI coding sessions into knowledge. Code Insights extracts patterns from your conversations—what you built, decisions you made, lessons learned—and presents them in a local visual dashboard.

## The Problem

AI coding tools store every conversation as files on your machine. Claude Code uses JSONL in `~/.claude/projects/`. Cursor stores state in SQLite. Codex CLI and Copilot CLI write their own session formats. This is valuable data:
- What features did you work on last week?
- Why did you choose that architecture?
- What mistakes did you make (and fix)?
- How much time went into different parts of the codebase?

But it's trapped in raw files. You can't search it, visualize it, or learn from it.

## The Solution

Code Insights provides:

1. **Automated extraction** — Parses session files from multiple AI coding tools and structures the data
2. **Smart session titles** — Auto-generates meaningful titles from session content
3. **Session classification** — Categorizes sessions (deep focus, bug hunt, feature build, etc.)
4. **LLM-powered analysis** — Multi-provider insight generation (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama) with your own API key
5. **Visual dashboard** — Local web interface with charts, timelines, and filters at `http://localhost:7890`
6. **CLI analytics** — Terminal stats via `code-insights stats` and subcommands

## Who It's For

- **Developers using multiple AI coding tools** who want to understand their AI-assisted work patterns across Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Copilot CLI, and VS Code Copilot Chat
- **Learners** who want to review and reinforce what they've built with AI assistants
- **Privacy-conscious developers** who want insights without giving up their data to a cloud service

## Privacy Model

**Fully local. No cloud. No accounts.**

Code Insights stores all session data in a SQLite database at `~/.code-insights/data.db` on your own machine. There is no central server, no sign-up, and no data sent anywhere. The dashboard runs locally at `http://localhost:7890` — served by a Hono API process on your own machine.

LLM analysis uses your own API key, stored in `~/.code-insights/config.json` (mode 0o600). API calls go directly from the local server to your chosen LLM provider — not through any Code Insights infrastructure.

**Telemetry:** Anonymous, aggregate usage signals via PostHog. Opt-out model (enabled by default). Respects `CODE_INSIGHTS_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` and `DO_NOT_TRACK` environment variables. No PII collected. See `code-insights telemetry` to manage.

## Core Features

### Multi-Source Support

| Source Tool | What's Captured |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Claude Code** | JSONL sessions from `~/.claude/projects/` |
| **Cursor** | Sessions from Cursor's local SQLite state |
| **Codex CLI** | Rollout files from `~/.codex/sessions/` |
| **Copilot CLI** | Event files from `~/.copilot/session-state/` |
| **VS Code Copilot Chat** | Sessions from VS Code Copilot Chat local storage |

### Insight Categories

| Category | What It Captures |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Summary** | High-level narrative of what was accomplished |
| **Decision** | Architecture choices, trade-offs, reasoning, alternatives considered |
| **Learning** | Technical discoveries, mistakes, transferable knowledge |
| **Technique** | Problem-solving approaches and debugging strategies |
| **Prompt Quality** | Efficiency scores, wasted turns, anti-patterns, improvement suggestions |

### Export

Two-tier export system for turning session knowledge into shareable and actionable artifacts:

**Session-level export** — per-session export of insights with two templates:
- **Knowledge Base** — Human-readable markdown with full insight content
- **Agent Rules** — Imperative instructions formatted for CLAUDE.md/.cursorrules

**Export Page** — LLM-powered cross-session synthesis:
- Reads across multiple sessions' insights to deduplicate, merge, and synthesize
- Generates agent rules via LLM (not just template formatting)
- 4 output formats: Agent Rules, Knowledge Brief, Obsidian (YAML frontmatter), Notion
- 3 depth presets: Essential (~25 insights), Standard (~80), Comprehensive (~200)
- SSE streaming with progress phases, AbortSignal support, token budget guard

### Reflect & Patterns

Cross-session pattern detection and synthesis, powered by session facets:

**Session Facets** — Structured metadata extracted during LLM analysis for each session:
- Outcome satisfaction (high/medium/low/mixed)
- Workflow pattern (iterative, plan-then-execute, exploratory, debugging, etc.)
- Friction points (categorized: unclear-requirements, wrong-approach, tool-limitations, etc.)
- Effective patterns (what worked well and why)
- Course correction tracking (whether the session changed direction and why)

**CLI Commands:**
- `code-insights reflect` — Generate cross-session synthesis with LLM (friction analysis, rules/skills, working style)
- `code-insights reflect backfill` — Backfill facets for sessions analyzed before facet support
- `code-insights stats patterns` — View pattern summary in the terminal

**Dashboard Patterns Page** — Three synthesis sections:
- **Friction & Wins** — Top friction categories ranked by frequency, effective patterns that worked
- **Rules & Skills** — Auto-generated agent rules, skill recommendations, and hook suggestions
- **Working Style** — Workflow distribution, outcome trends, session character analysis

**Technical details:**
- Dedicated `session_facets` SQLite table (Schema V3) with indexed scalar columns and JSON arrays
- Facet extraction integrated into the existing analysis prompt (facets first, then insights)
- Lightweight facet-only backfill for previously-analyzed sessions (summary + first/last 20 messages)
- Friction category normalization via Levenshtein distance matching to canonical categories
- Synthesis prompts pre-aggregate data in code, then feed ranked summaries to LLM for narration
- Reflect snapshots cached in `reflect_snapshots` table (Schema V4) with staleness tracking
- 20-session minimum threshold for meaningful synthesis; coverage warning when < 50% analyzed

### Dashboard Views

### CLI Stats Commands

```bash
code-insights stats              # Overview (last 7 days)
code-insights stats cost         # Cost breakdown by project and model
code-insights stats projects     # Per-project detail cards
code-insights stats today        # Today's sessions with details
code-insights stats models       # Model usage distribution
code-insights stats patterns     # Cross-session pattern summary
```

## Multi-Source Architecture

Code Insights uses a **provider abstraction** to support multiple AI coding tools through a common interface:

```
Source tool session files -> Provider (discover + parse) -> SQLite -> Dashboard / CLI stats
```

Each provider implements the `SessionProvider` interface (`discover()`, `parse()`, `getProviderName()`), normalizing tool-specific formats into the shared `ParsedSession` schema.

### How Each Tool Stores Sessions

| Tool | Format | Location (macOS) |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| **Claude Code** | JSONL (append-only, one JSON object per line) | `~/.claude/projects/<path>/<id>.jsonl` |
| **Cursor** | SQLite key-value (`state.vscdb`, JSON blobs) | `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/` |
| **Codex CLI** | JSONL (event-based stream) | `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl` |
| **Copilot CLI** | JSONL (events) | `~/.copilot/session-state/{id}/events.jsonl` |
| **VS Code Copilot Chat** | JSON | Platform-specific Copilot Chat storage |

### Platform Paths

| Tool | macOS | Linux | Windows |
|------|-------|-------|---------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/projects/` | `~/.claude/projects/` | `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\projects\` |
| Cursor | `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/` | `~/.config/Cursor/User/` | `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\` |
| Codex CLI | `~/.codex/sessions/` | `~/.codex/sessions/` | `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\sessions\` |
| Copilot CLI | `~/.copilot/session-state/` | `~/.copilot/session-state/` | `%USERPROFILE%\.copilot\session-state\` |

Adding a new source tool requires implementing the `SessionProvider` interface in `cli/src/providers/`, registering it in the provider registry, and adding dashboard display support (colors, avatars, filter options).

## Tech Stack

- **CLI**: Node.js (ES2022, ES Modules), Commander.js
