# /release — Automated Release Workflow

**Arguments**: $ARGUMENTS

You are executing the release workflow for `@code-insights/cli`. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to extract:
- **type** (required): `patch`, `minor`, or `major`
- **description** (optional): A one-liner for the release title

If type is missing or not one of `patch`/`minor`/`major`, ask the user to provide it.

---

## Step 1: Pre-flight Checks

Run ALL of these checks. If any fail, STOP and tell the user what to fix.

```bash
# Must be on master
git branch --show-current  # Must output "master"

# Must have clean working tree
git status --porcelain     # Must be empty

# Pull latest
git pull origin master
```

Read the current version from `cli/package.json` (the `"version"` field).

Compute the new version:
- `patch`: increment the third number (3.6.1 → 3.6.2)
- `minor`: increment the second number, reset third to 0 (3.6.1 → 3.7.0)
- `major`: increment the first number, reset second and third to 0 (3.6.1 → 4.0.0)

**Resume detection**: Run `npm view @code-insights/cli version` to get the currently published version. If the version in `package.json` is ALREADY GREATER than the npm version, this is a **resumed release** — skip to Step 6.

---

## Step 2: Analyze Changes

Find the last git tag and analyze what changed:

```bash
# Find latest tag
git describe --tags --abbrev=0

# Commits since last tag
git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --oneline

# Full diff since last tag
git diff $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --stat
```

Read the full diff and commit messages. Then:

1. **Generate a CHANGELOG entry** in the existing format (see `cli/CHANGELOG.md` for style). Group changes under `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`, `### Improved` as appropriate. Match the existing tone — concise but descriptive, with bold lead-ins.

2. **Generate a release title** — a short phrase summarizing the release (e.g., "LLM-Powered Export Page", "PostHog custom domain"). Use the user's description if provided, otherwise derive from the changes.

3. **For minor/major releases**: Assess which docs need updating:
   - `docs/ROADMAP.md` — if new milestones were completed
   - `docs/PRODUCT.md` — if product capabilities changed
   - `docs/VISION.md` — for major releases, if the vision expanded
   - `README.md` — if user-facing features or setup changed

---

## GATE 1: Review Changelog

**STOP and present to the user:**

```
Release: vX.Y.Z — {title}
Type: {patch|minor|major}

Proposed CHANGELOG entry:
─────────────────────────
{the generated changelog entry}
─────────────────────────

Files to modify:
  - cli/package.json (version bump)
  - cli/CHANGELOG.md (new entry)
  {- docs/ROADMAP.md (if applicable)}
  {- docs/PRODUCT.md (if applicable)}
  {- docs/VISION.md (if applicable)}

Approve, or tell me what to change?
```

Wait for user approval. If they provide edits, incorporate them.

---

## Step 3: Apply Version Bump

After approval, make the changes:

1. **`cli/package.json`** — Update the `"version"` field to the new version
2. **`cli/CHANGELOG.md`** — Prepend the new entry at the top (after the header, before the previous version entry). Format: `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
3. **Docs** (if approved at Gate 1) — Make the specific updates discussed

---

## Step 4: Build & Test

Run the full build and test suite:

```bash
# Full workspace build (this is what prepublishOnly does)
cd /Users/melagiri/Workspace/codeInsights/code-insights && pnpm build

# Run tests
cd /Users/melagiri/Workspace/codeInsights/code-insights/cli && pnpm test
```

**If build fails → STOP.** Show the error. Do not continue.
**If tests fail → STOP.** Show the error. Do not continue.

---

## GATE 2: Confirm Publish

**STOP and present to the user:**

Show the full `git diff` of all changes made, then:

```
Build: PASSED
Tests: PASSED

Ready to:
  1. Commit changes to master
  2. Push to origin
  3. Publish v{X.Y.Z} to npm
  4. Create GitHub release

Proceed?
```

Wait for explicit user approval before continuing.

---

## Step 5: Commit & Push

Commit with specific files only (never `git add .`):

```bash
# Add only the files we changed
git add cli/package.json cli/CHANGELOG.md
# Add any docs files that were modified (if applicable)
# git add docs/ROADMAP.md docs/PRODUCT.md docs/VISION.md README.md

git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
chore: bump version to vX.Y.Z

{one-line summary of what changed}

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"

git push origin master
```

---

## Step 6: Publish to npm

```bash
cd /Users/melagiri/Workspace/codeInsights/code-insights/cli && npm publish
```

The `prepublishOnly` script in `package.json` handles building all packages and copying dashboard/server dist files automatically.

Verify the publish succeeded:

```bash
npm view @code-insights/cli version
```

If publish fails, show the error and STOP. The commit is already pushed — tell the user to fix the issue and re-run `/release` (resume detection will skip to this step).

---

## Step 7: GitHub Release

Create the GitHub release using the changelog entry as the body:

```bash
gh release create vX.Y.Z \
  --title "vX.Y.Z — {release title}" \
  --notes "$(cat <<'EOF'
{changelog entry content, formatted for GitHub}

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/melagiri/code-insights/compare/{previous_tag}...vX.Y.Z
EOF
)"
```

---

## GATE 3: Verify

**STOP and present to the user:**

```
Release vX.Y.Z complete!

  npm: @code-insights/cli@X.Y.Z ✓
  GitHub: {release URL}
  Commit: {commit hash}

Everything look correct?
```

---

## Step 8: Done

Summarize the release:

```
Released @code-insights/cli vX.Y.Z

  Changes: {brief summary}
  npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@code-insights/cli
  GitHub: {release URL}
  Files modified: {list}
```

---

## Important Rules

- **NEVER skip the gates** — always pause for user confirmation
- **NEVER use `git add .` or `git add -A`** — add specific files only
- **If build or tests fail, STOP** — do not try to fix and continue
- **Commit message format**: `chore: bump version to vX.Y.Z` (matches existing pattern)
- **Resume is safe** — if re-run after a partial release, it picks up where it left off
